Pre-requisites
-------------------

These istructions assume a Linux installation with python2.4, easy_install, 
and setuptools.


Kirbi installation
---------------------

1. Checkout the Kirbi code and move to the directory created::

    luciano@u704:~$ svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/Sandbox/luciano/kirbi kirbi
    luciano@u704:~$ cd kirbi/

2. Invoke the bootstrap script with python2.4::

    luciano@u704:~/kirbi$ python2.4 bootstrap/bootstrap.py

Some files will be downloaded and installed.

3. Invoke the buildout script created by the bootstrap::

    luciano@u704: ~/kirbi$ bin/buildout 

Lots of files will be downloaded and installed.

4. Start the Zope 3 server::

    luciano@u704:~/kirbi$ bin/zopectl start

5. Open a Web browser and point it at::

    http://localhost:8080/

When prompted, enter username grok, password grok.
At the Grok admin interface, create a Kirbi instance called kirbi
(that name is hardcoded into the fetch.py script we will run shortly).


Kirbifetch installation
---------------------------

Currently Kirbifetch is not configured to use the same Python libs as
Kirbi, so we need to install several components by hand, some of which
Kirbi already downloaded and installed, but not where the system python 
expects to find them. Sorry about that...

1. Install zope.interface (Twisted requires it)::

    luciano@u704:~/kirbi$ sudo su -
    root@u704:~# easy_install zope.interface

2. Install zope.schema and ElementTree (fetch.py require them; if lxml is
   already installed you can skip the ElementTree bit; fetch tries to use
   lxml before falling back on ElementTree)::

    root@u704:~# easy_install zope.schema
    root@u704:~# easy_install elementtree

3. Download and install Twisted::

    root@u704:~# http://tmrc.mit.edu/mirror/twisted/Twisted/2.5/Twisted-2.5.0.tar.bz2
    root@u704:~# bunzip2 Twisted-2.5.0.tar.bz2 
    root@u704:~# tar xvf Twisted-2.5.0.tar 
    root@u704:~# cd Twisted-2.5.0
    root@u704:~/Twisted-2.5.0# python2.4 setup.py install

Twisted will be built and installed. 


Running Kirbifetch
------------------------

Now the fetch.py script can be invoked. Note that fetch.py runs it's own 
Twisted reactor, so it's a long running script::

    luciano@u704:~/kirbi$ cd kirbifetch/src/kirbifetch
    luciano@u704:~/kirbi/kirbifetch/src/kirbifetch$ fetch.py

Note that fetch.py must be invoked from the directory where it resides,
because of the way the path to the cover image diretctories coded in the
``Fetch.downloadedItemsPage`` method.


Trying out Kirbi and Kirbifetch
-----------------------------------

1. Go to::

    http://localhost:8080/kirbi

2. Click on the "catalog" menu.

3. Click on the "Add Several Books" link. 

4. Enter one or more ISBN numbers.

5. Click on the "catalog" menu again. The books should appear. 


What if some book data is missing?
-----------------------------------

If the main catalog lists only the ISBN instead of the title, Kirbifetch 
has not yet retrieved the data. Wait a few more seconds and reload. If 
still no results, click on the "incomplete" menu. The ISBNs should be 
listed there.

If there are ISBNs listed under "New Book Records Without Title" and 
they remain there fore several seconds, then Kirbifetch is not working.

If there are ISBNs listed under "Pending Book Searches", then Kirbifetch
is working, but could not find data about those books at Amazon.com. 
You can click on the links to several online catalogs to search for that 
ISBN manually.
